## How to Add Your Logos

To display your actual gym logos on the hero page, please add the following image files to this directory:

### Required Images:

1. **vian-logo.png** - Vian Gymation Logo (the circular logo with muscular figure)
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger
   - Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
   - This is the main Vian-Eli Gymation logo

2. **fitmate-logo.png** - FitMate Logo (the FitMate branding logo)
   - Recommended size: 400x200 pixels or larger  
   - Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
   - This is the FitMate application logo

### Steps to Add:

1. Save your Vian Gymation logo as `vian-logo.png` in this folder
2. Save your FitMate logo as `fitmate-logo.png` in this folder
3. The hero page will automatically load these images
4. If images are not found, it will show a styled fallback version

### Current Location:
```
frontend/
  public/
    assets/
      vian-logo.png      <- Add here
      fitmate-logo.png   <- Add here
      README.md          <- You are here
```

### Notes:
- Use high-resolution images for best quality
- PNG format with transparent backgrounds works best
- The images will be automatically scaled to fit the design
- No code changes needed - just add the files and refresh your browser
